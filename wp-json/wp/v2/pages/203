The purpose of workshops is to provide a forum for exchanging opinions, presenting ideas, and discussing preliminary results in an interactive atmosphere.<\/p>\n<p class=\"part\" data-startline=\"6\" data-endline=\"6\">Please note that no online\/hybrid workshops will be held this year.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"important-dates-workshops\" class=\"part\" data-startline=\"8\" data-endline=\"8\"><i class=\"fa fa-link\"><\/i>Important dates (workshops)<\/h2>\n<p class=\"part\" data-startline=\"10\" data-endline=\"12\">Workshop proposals due: 30 October 2021<br \/>\nAcceptance notification: 13 November 2021<br \/>\nDate of workshops: 5 April 2022<\/p>\n<p class=\"part\" data-startline=\"14\" data-endline=\"14\">All deadline times are Anywhere on Earth (AoE).<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"proposal-format\" class=\"part\" data-startline=\"16\" data-endline=\"16\"><i class=\"fa fa-link\"><\/i>Proposal format<\/h2>\n<p class=\"part\" data-startline=\"18\" data-endline=\"18\">Proposals should include (within the limit of 5 pages):<\/p>\n<ul class=\"part\" data-startline=\"20\" data-endline=\"26\">\n<li class=\"\" data-startline=\"20\" data-endline=\"20\">The workshop name and a 150\u2013200-word abstract describing the workshop, suitable for the conference web site.<\/li>\n<li class=\"\" data-startline=\"21\" data-endline=\"21\">A brief CV of each of the organizers including contact addresses and an identification of a single primary contact.<\/li>\n<li class=\"\" data-startline=\"22\" data-endline=\"22\">A short summary of the topic, scope and significance of the workshop, including a discussion on the relevance to EuroSys topics (please include information about past iterations of the workshop, if any).<\/li>\n<li class=\"\" data-startline=\"23\" data-endline=\"23\">Information about the procedure for selecting papers and\/or presentations, plans for dissemination (for example, online proceedings, special issues of journals, position statements distributed to the participants, etc.), the expected number of participants, and the planned workshop format.<\/li>\n<li class=\"\" data-startline=\"24\" data-endline=\"24\">Tentative schedule including paper submission dates, notification dates, camera- ready dates (if any), and registration.<\/li>\n<li class=\"\" data-startline=\"25\" data-endline=\"26\">Indicate whether the workshop is a half- or full-day event.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p class=\"part\" data-startline=\"27\" data-endline=\"27\">The definite dates for workshop submissions and camera-ready deadlines are yet to be set. However, we expect that EuroSys paper notifications will be sent out by early January 2022, thus the workshop submission deadlines should be after that if you expect that authors of rejected papers might want to submit to your workshop.<\/p>\n<p class=\"part\" data-startline=\"29\" data-endline=\"29\">Workshop notifications must probably be sent out by the end of February 2022, so that authors can benefit from the early registration rate and students can apply for travel grants. Workshop organizers will be expected to agree with the workshop chairs on the dates used for their workshop before announcing them.<\/p>\n<p class=\"part\" data-startline=\"31\" data-endline=\"31\">All proposals will be judged on their merits and the best proposals will be accepted. Specifically, workshops that have been organized at previous iterations of Eurosys are not automatically accepted this year. For instance, we will take into account the success of previous events (in terms of attendance, submissions, etc.) in our deliberations.<\/p>\n<p class=\"part\" data-startline=\"33\" data-endline=\"33\">All workshops will be offered to participate in a common poster and demonstration session in the afternoon of the workshops day, similarly to some of the previous EuroSys occurrences. The afternoon coffee break will be extended to one hour to accommodate this session. Workshop organizers will be encouraged to propose their speakers and authors to prepare a poster or demonstration for this common session, in order to stimulate intra- and inter-workshop interactions.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"responsibilities\" class=\"part\" data-startline=\"35\" data-endline=\"35\"><i class=\"fa fa-link\"><\/i>Responsibilities<\/h2>\n<p class=\"part\" data-startline=\"37\" data-endline=\"37\">The EuroSys organization provides:<\/p>\n<ul class=\"part\" data-startline=\"39\" data-endline=\"44\">\n<li class=\"\" data-startline=\"39\" data-endline=\"39\">A link on the EuroSys Web site<\/li>\n<li class=\"\" data-startline=\"40\" data-endline=\"40\">Management of registration for participants<\/li>\n<li class=\"\" data-startline=\"41\" data-endline=\"41\">Setup of meeting space and related equipment<\/li>\n<li class=\"\" data-startline=\"42\" data-endline=\"42\">Coffee-breaks and workshop lunch arrangements<\/li>\n<li class=\"\" data-startline=\"43\" data-endline=\"44\">Organization of the common poster and demonstration session during the extended afternoon coffee break<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p class=\"part\" data-startline=\"45\" data-endline=\"45\">The publication of proceedings is not a requirement for EuroSys workshops. For workshops interested in publishing their proceedings on the ACM Digital Library, the EuroSys organization will provide the following support. Workshop proceedings will be published in separate volumes from the EuroSys conference proceedings, but will be listed as side events of the conference in the ACM Digital Library. The publication process is under the responsibility of the workshop organizers but the main conference publication chair will provide the following bootstrap support:<\/p>\n<ul class=\"part\" data-startline=\"47\" data-endline=\"50\">\n<li class=\"\" data-startline=\"47\" data-endline=\"47\">Establish contact between the ACM services and workshop publication officers<\/li>\n<li class=\"\" data-startline=\"48\" data-endline=\"48\">Provide ISBN numbers<\/li>\n<li class=\"\" data-startline=\"49\" data-endline=\"50\">Provide support for publishing on the on-site proceedings volume (e.g. USB key)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p class=\"part\" data-startline=\"51\" data-endline=\"51\">The main responsibility of organizing a workshop goes to the chairperson(s) of the workshop.
