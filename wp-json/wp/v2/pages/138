EuroSys 2022 seeks papers on all areas of computer systems research, including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Operating systems<\/li>\n<li>Distributed systems<\/li>\n<li>Cloud computing and datacenter systems<\/li>\n<li>File and storage systems<\/li>\n<li>Networked systems<\/li>\n<li>Language support and runtime systems<\/li>\n<li>Systems security and privacy<\/li>\n<li>Dependable systems<\/li>\n<li>Analysis, testing and veri\ufb01cation of systems<\/li>\n<li>Database systems and data analytics frameworks<\/li>\n<li>Virtualization and virtualized systems<\/li>\n<li>Systems for machine learning\/machine learning for systems<\/li>\n<li>Mobile and pervasive systems<\/li>\n<li>Parallelism, concurrency, and multicore systems<\/li>\n<li>Real-time, embedded, and cyber-physical systems<\/li>\n<li>Systems for emerging hardware<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>We encourage papers that span multiple topics and communities. Papers will be judged on novelty, signi\ufb01cance, correctness, and clarity. The program committee seeks papers that address a signi\ufb01cant problem with an interesting and compelling solution, whose validity and practicality are clearly demonstrated. A good paper will draw appropriate conclusions, honestly present related prior work, acknowledge its own limitations, and clearly articulate the advances it offers over prior work.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"important_dates\">Important dates<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Abstract submission: <strong>1 October 2021<\/strong><\/li>\n<li>Paper submission: <strong>9 October 2021<\/strong><\/li>\n<li>Author response period: <strong>3-6 January 2022<\/strong><\/li>\n<li>Notification of conditional accept \/ revise \/ reject: <strong>20 January 2022<\/strong><\/li>\n<li>Revision submission (selected papers): <strong>20 February 2022<\/strong><\/li>\n<li>Notification of conditional accept\/reject for revisions: <strong>3 March 2022<\/strong><\/li>\n<li>Camera-ready submission (all accepted papers):\u00a0<strong>15 Mars 2022<\/strong><\/li>\n<li>Main conference program: <strong>5-8 April 2022<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>All deadline times are <strong>23:59 hrs UTC<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>For any further information, please contact the PC chairs:<\/strong> <a href=\"mailto:pc-chairs-2022@eurosys.org\">pc-chairs-2022@eurosys.org<\/a><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Anne-Marie Kermarrec (EPFL)<\/li>\n<li>Christos Kozyrakis (Stanford University)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2 id=\"submission_instructions\">Submission instructions<\/h2>\n<p><strong>Submit your paper at:<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/eurosys22.hotcrp.com\/\">https:\/\/eurosys22.hotcrp.com\/<\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Anonymity<\/strong>: Reviewing is double-blind, meaning that the authors\u2018 identities will be hidden from the reviewers and vice versa. Authors must make a good faith effort to anonymize their submissions, and they should not identify themselves either explicitly or by implication (e.g., through the references or acknowledgments). Authors should be listed as<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Anonymous Author(s)<\/li>\n<li>Submission Id: &lt;Paper-ID&gt; where the &lt;Paper-ID&gt; is the ID assigned after abstract registration.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Use care in referring to your own related work. Do not omit references to your prior work, as this would make it difficult for reviewers to place your submission in its proper context. Instead, reference your past work in the third person, just as you would any other piece of related work. For example, you might say \u201cOur system modifies the XYZ operating system built by Smith et al. [17]\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>If your submission extends a previous workshop paper, or it may relate to a submission currently under review. In these cases, you must still explain the differences between your present submission and the other work, but you should cite the other work anonymously and e-mail the deanonymized work to the PC chairs.<\/p>\n<p>Authors are permitted to post drafts of their submission on e.g. arxiv or as technical reports on their institution&#8217;s website. However, the submitted version should have a substantially different title, and a different system\/tool name (if it uses one) from the draft version.<\/p>\n<p>Submissions violating the detailed formatting and anonymization rules will not be considered for review. EuroSys applies ACM\u2018s policies for plagiarism, conflicts of interest, submission con\ufb01dentiality, reviewer anonymity, and prior and concurrent paper submission. If you are uncertain about how to anonymize your submission, whether or not your submissions meet these guidelines, or have speci\ufb01c questions about the guidelines, please contact the program co-chairs, <a href=\"mailto:pc-chairs-2022@eurosys.org\">pc-chairs-2022@eurosys.org<\/a>, well in advance of the submission deadline.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Conflicts: <\/strong>When registering and submitting your paper, you will need to provide information about conflicts with PC members. Use the following guidelines to determine conflicts:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Institution:<\/strong> You are currently employed at the same institution, have been previously employed at the same institution within the past two years, or are going to begin employment at the same institution.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Advisor or Collaboration:<\/strong> You have a past or present association as thesis advisor or advisee, or you have a collaboration on a project, publication, grant proposal, or editorship within the past two years (2020 or later), or reasonably expect one within the next year.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>More details on the conflict of interest policy can be found at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.acm.org\/publications\/policies\/conflict-of-interest\">the ACM website<\/a><\/p>\n<p>The PC chairs will review paper conflicts to ensure the integrity of the reviewing process, adding conflicts if necessary. Similarly, if there is no basis for conflicts provided by authors, such conflicts will be removed. Improperly identifying PC members as a conflict in an attempt to avoid having an individual review your paper may lead to the submission being rejected without review. If you have any questions about conflicts, please contact the program co-chairs (<a href=\"mailto:pc-chairs-2022@eurosys.org\">pc-chairs-2022@eurosys.org<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p><strong>Page limit and formatting: <\/strong>Submissions may have at most 12 pages of technical content, including all text, figures, tables, appendices, etc. Bibliographic references are not included in the 12-page limit. Use A4 or US letter paper size, with all text and figures fitting inside a 178 x 229 mm (7 x 9 in) block centered on the page, using two columns separated by \u22658 mm (0.33\u2033) of whitespace. Use \u226510-point font (typeface Times Roman, Linux Libertine, etc.) on \u226512-point (single-spaced) leading for all text including figure and table captions. Graphs and figures should be readable when printed in grayscale, without magnification. All pages should be numbered. Authors are encouraged to hyperlink their references.<\/p>\n<p>Most of these rules are automatically applied when using the official SIGPLAN Latex\u00a0(\\documentclass[sigplan, &#8230; ]) or MS Word templates from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.acm.org\/publications\/authors\/submissions\">here<\/a>. For any paper parameters not defined above, assume that the required value is the one used in these templates.<\/p>\n<p>Any papers that deviate significantly from the formatting instructions will be administratively rejected.<\/p>\n<p>For Latex, we recommend you use (where &lt;PAPER_ID&gt; is the paper ID you received after abstract registration):<\/p>\n<pre>\\documentclass[sigplan,review,anonymous]{acmart}\r\n\\acmSubmissionID{&lt;PAPER_ID&gt;}\r\n\\renewcommand\\footnotetextcopyrightpermission[1]{}\r\n% Optional: Remove the ACM reference between the abstract and the main text.\r\n\\settopmatter{printfolios=true,printacmref=false}\r\n% Optional: Comment out the CCS concepts and keywords.\r\n...<\/pre>\n<h2 id=\"authors_response\">Authors\u2019 response<\/h2>\n<p>As it has been standard practice in OSDI and SOSP in recent years, we will allow authors to submit quick responses to the reviews. The responses will be taken into account during the PC discussions and the PC meeting. The response period will be 3-6 January 2022.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"paper_revisions\">Paper revisions<\/h2>\n<p>A few papers that are deemed to broadly meet the criteria for acceptance except in few clearly-identified and important aspects will be asked to submit a revised version for re-evaluation. Authors will have roughly a month to prepare their revision. The revision process is intended to be a constructive partnership between reviewers and authors. To this end, reviewers will be instructed to request revisions only in constructive scenarios with very specific requests. In turn, authors bear the responsibility of attempting to meet those requests within the stated time frame, or of withdrawing the paper. Common revision requests can include &#8221;justify a crucial assumption&#8221;, &#8221;present a real(istic) scenario where the defined problem occurs&#8221;, &#8221;clean up notation&#8221;, &#8221;tighten presentation&#8221;, &#8221;compare against some relevant previous system&#8221;, &#8221;show experimental results with better data, such as at larger scale or from a real system&#8221;. Revisions will not be requested to address lack of technical depth or novelty or where the revised paper will address a substantially different problem from the original.<\/p>\n<p>Please note:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Papers asked to submit revisions for reevaluation are not tentatively accepted. Upon resubmission, they will be reconsidered based on how well the authors addressed the reviewers\u2019 requests. There is absolutely no guarantee of final acceptance.<\/li>\n<li>All accepted papers are to be understood as provisionally accepted: \ufb01nal acceptance will be subject to shepherding by a member of the program committee.<\/li>\n<li>Authors should take note that the official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2 id=\"artifact_evaluation\">Artifact Evaluation (AE)<\/h2>\n<p>The goal of AE is to promote the reproducibility of experimental results and to encourage authors to provide useful artifacts that help the community quickly validate and compare alternative approaches. <strong>This submission is voluntary and will not influence the final decision regarding the papers<\/strong>. AE will be run by a separate committee whose task is to assess how the artifacts support the work described in the papers.<\/p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong><strong>Additional information is available on<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/sysartifacts.github.io\/eurosys2022\/\">the EuroSys 2022 Artifact evaluation webpage<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"awards\">Awards<\/h2>\n<p>EuroSys grants two best paper awards, one sponsored by ACM Europe Council and one by ACM EuroSys Chapter.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"camera_ready_instructions\">Camera-ready instructions<\/h2>\n<p><strong>Rights forms: <\/strong>In your paper\u2019s HotCRP page (<a href=\"https:\/\/eurosys22.hotcrp.com\/\">https:\/\/eurosys22.hotcrp.com\/<\/a>) you will find a link to the ACM copyright form. Once completed, ACM will send you the information and Latex directives (DOI, ISBN, etc.) needed to complete the camera-ready version of your paper.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Camera-ready format: <\/strong>You should use the acmart document class (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.acm.org\/publications\/proceedings-template\">https:\/\/www.acm.org\/publications\/proceedings-template<\/a>, the same as for submission), as follows: \\documentclass[sigplan,10pt]{acmart}<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ll receive the instruction regarding some Latex directives (\\setcopyright, \\acmConference, \\acmDOI, etc.) after completing the copyright form.<\/p>\n<p>All accepted papers can use up to 2 additional pages for the camera-ready version, for a final limit of 14 pages, references not included. Papers that successfully completed the Artifact Evaluation process can use up to 2 further additional pages, as an &#8216;Artifact Appendix&#8217;, to document the artifacts. Any badges awarded as part of the Artifact Evaluation process will be automatically added after the camera-ready submission.<\/p>\n<p>Note that Type 1 fonts (scalable) should be used, not Type 3 (bit-mapped), and that all fonts must be embedded. Type and embedding of fonts can be checked with various tools including \u201cpdffonts\u201d. Page numbers should be suppressed. Make also sure that the PDF is searchable by testing the search function in a PDF reader.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Uploading final versions: <\/strong>The final version of your paper should be uploaded through HotCRP: <a href=\"https:\/\/eurosys22.hotcrp.com\/\">https:\/\/eurosys22.hotcrp.com\/<\/a>.
